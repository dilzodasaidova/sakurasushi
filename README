### Project Structure

To maintain consistency and organization, components are grouped by functionality. 

Example directory structure:

---

### Coding Standards

Coding standards promote readability and maintainability:
- **Language:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Best Practices:** 
  - Functions should be concise and single-responsibility
  - Avoid global variables, encapsulate logic where possible
- **Code Style:** Consistent indentation, comments for complex logic

---

### Naming Conventions

Uniform naming conventions make code easier to navigate:
- **Files/Folders:** Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `order-summary.html`)
- **Variables/Functions:** Use camelCase (e.g., `orderData`)
- **Constants:** UPPERCASE with underscores (e.g., `BASE_API_URL`)

---

### Branching Strategy

To organize and control code integration, we use the following branching strategy:

- **main:** Stable, production-ready code
- **develop:** Integrates stable code for development
- **feature/\<feature-name\>:** For new features, merged into `develop`
- **bugfix/\<bug-name\>:** For fixes, merged into `develop` or `main` if critical
- **release/\<version-number\>:** Code prep for production, merged into `main` and `develop`

Refer to `docs/BranchingGuidelines.md` for detailed instructions.

---

### Technology Stack

This project uses a minimal stack to ensure easy setup and scalability:
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Backend:** Basic server setup (e.g., Node.js or Python for API endpoints)
- **Database:** SQLite or flat-file data storage for simplicity
- **Version Control:** Git (hosted on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)

Refer to `docs/TechStack.md` for more information.

---

### System Architecture

Designed for modularity and simplicity, the architecture is organized by clear functional blocks.

- **Components:** UI components manage user interactions, while services handle data processing.
- **Backend:** Structured API endpoints to handle data retrieval and updates.

An architecture diagram is available in `docs/ArchitectureDiagram.png`.

---

### Repository Configuration

Repository setup for effective version control and team collaboration:

- **Repository Name:** `sakura-bar-sushi`
- **Visibility:** Private
- **Access Control:** Managed permissions for read/write access
- **Branch Protections:** Protect `main` and `develop` branches; pull requests are required for merges

Details are documented in `docs/RepoConfig.md`.

---

### Dependencies and Tools

Essential tools for development and testing:


- **Package Manager:** Optional (npm or pip)
- **Testing:** Vanilla JavaScript tests for functionality
- **CI/CD:** Basic manual testing workflow; optional CI with GitHub Actions

To install any necessary tools, consult `docs/Dependencies.md`.

---

### Documentation and Onboarding

Comprehensive documentation aids team onboarding and ensures smooth development:

- **Coding Standards:** `docs/CodingStandards.md`
- **Branching Guidelines:** `docs/BranchingGuidelines.md`
- **Tech Stack:** `docs/TechStack.md`
- **System Architecture:** `docs/ArchitectureDiagram.png`
